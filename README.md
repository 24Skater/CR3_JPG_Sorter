## Quick Start (Python GUI)
1. **Requirements:** Python 3.8+ and install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install tkinterdnd2
   ```
2. **Run the app:**
   ```
   python ImageSorterGUI_v4.py
   ```
3. **Usage:**
   - **Drag & drop** a folder onto the window, or click 'Browse' to select.
   - (Optional) Check 'Include subfolders (recursive)' to sort recursively.
   - (Optional) Check 'Move unsupported files to Other folder'.
   - Click 'Preview' to see what will be moved (recommended first time).
   - Click 'Sort Images' to perform the sort operation.
   - View **statistics** after sorting showing breakdown by type.
   - Use '**Undo Last Sort**' button to reverse if needed.
   - Use 'Cancel' to stop during sorting.
   - Check `logs/` folder for detailed operation logs.

## Configuration
The app stores preferences in `config.json`:
- Last used folder
- Checkbox states (recursive, move_other)
- Window size and position
- Custom file extensions

To add custom file extensions, edit `config.json` and add to the `custom_extensions` array:
```json
{
  "custom_extensions": [".heic", ".webp"]
}
```

## Download

**[Download the latest installer from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/24Skater/CR3_JPG_Sorter/releases/latest)**

Or build from source:

## Packaging as an .exe
- Install PyInstaller:
  ```

  ```
- The `.exe` will be in the `dist/ImageSorter/` folder.

## Creating a Windows Installer
- Use Inno Setup to create a professional installer with Start Menu and desktop shortcut support.
- Compile `imagesorter.iss` with Inno Setup after building the .exe.
- Output: `dist/ImageSorterSetup.exe`
