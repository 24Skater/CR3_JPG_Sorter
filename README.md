# CR3_JPG_Sorter
Sorts Canon RAW (.CR3) and JPEG files into separate folders via PowerShell


# CR3 and JPG Sorter for Canon Files

A simple PowerShell script to move `.CR3` (RAW) and `.JPG` files into their own folders.

## ü§î Why This Exists

As a photographer and media coordinator, I regularly import hundreds of photos and RAW files from Canon DSLRs. Manually separating `.CR3` (RAW) and `.JPG` files takes time and risks errors. This script makes that workflow instant, reliable, and repeatable.

I built it to streamline sorting after events like church services, VBS, or photo shoots ‚Äî and now I‚Äôm sharing it to help others save time too.

Built by [EmRamos](https://github.com/EmRamos) to serve content creators, church tech teams, and photo pros who want automation without complexity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

This script is intended for users who are comfortable using PowerShell. You should be familiar with:

- Navigating directories in PowerShell
- Running scripts (e.g., `.\CR3andJPGSorter.ps1`)

This script does **not** include a GUI ‚Äî it runs entirely in a PowerShell terminal with prompts and text feedback.
